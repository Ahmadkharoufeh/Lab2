### Executive Summary
After watching and reading both of the passages it gives me an idea of what the computer process is. Like how it gets its data and what it needs to do. Besides telling me what the data processes it it told me about a few companies and what each one is and also what it does. It also talk about to make your computer to run fast and to add more higher ram .


### Hardware 
ALU and the Control Unit: The control unit tells the Alu what to do then the alu does the work and puts out the answer. Then the aul helps the control unit on what to do next after it get the answer 
The cpu: calculated the information 
Input: convert physical input to binary information 
Output: cover information tpo physical output
Logic Gates: The truth table shows the output you get for the input you get to show what the sets.
 IEEE - Ethically Aligned Design. IEEE is thelargest technicalorganization dedicated to advancing technology for the benefit of humanity. 


### CPU 
The Cpu is basically the brains of the computer and does any type of commands it receives from some of the other components.
The company are Multiple Processors, Motherboards,Hard Disk, SSD, Removable Media, Network Connection, and Input and Output
 

### Difference in SSD and a Traditional hard drive.
In A  solid state drive it is a storage folder that holds memory to hold data. SSD have no moving parts and data is saved for memory.(new path) A traditional hard drive is the same thing as a ssd but it is older and has some flaws compared to the ssd.


### Why does increasing RAM make the computer run faster
Having more Ram makes your computer run faster because it is increasing more data that can be loaded onto the ram without going back to the low hard drive. 


###  What is the difference between 64 and 32 bit data paths? 
The difference between a 64 bit data and a 32 bit data is the more the bit data the faster the computer will run.




 ### Data Representation 
Numeric Conversions 
Talkign about each one of these are kinda hard dinary is when you sub thew numbers that fit in to the number you are giviin. 
the decimal is when you see what  number fits in the number that are giving
Hexadecimal Color Representation is
