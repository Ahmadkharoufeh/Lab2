Besides telling me what the data processes it it told me about a few companies and what each one is and also what it does. It also talk about to make your computer to run fast and to add more higher ram .

### Difference in SSD and a Traditional hard drive.
In A  solid state drive it is a storage folder that holds memory to hold data. SSD have no moving parts and data is saved for memory.(new path) A traditional hard drive is the same thing as a ssd but it is older and has some flaws compared to the ssd.


### Why does increasing RAM make the computer run faster
Having more Ram makes your computer run faster because it is increasing more data that can be loaded onto the ram without going back to the low hard drive. 


###  What is the difference between 64 and 32 bit data paths? 
The difference between a 64 bit data and a 32 bit data is the more the bit data the faster the computer will run.
